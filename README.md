# SPAmix-Gene
A scalable, accurate, and universal analysis framework to control for population structure in admixed populations on large-scale set-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS). SPAmix-Gene extends [SPAmix](https://wenjianbi.github.io/grab.github.io/docs/approach_SPACox.html) to set-based association tests.
